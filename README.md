# Work in Progess!! Models can be used but documentation is not complete yet!

# SorpPump
Repository for sharing of sorption heat pump models.

# Working Principle
The models solve mass- and energy balances for all heat exchangers in the absorption heat pump cycle. 
For the solution and fluid states at the ourlet of the heat exchnagers, assumptions are made.

# Fluid State Calculation
For the calculation of LiBr-H2O solution properties, formulations from Patek and Klomfar are used. 
For the calculation of H2O-NH3 solution properties, REFPROP is used. Alternatively, the formulations from Patek and Klomfar can be used.
For the calculation of the pure refrigerant properties, CoolProp is used.
