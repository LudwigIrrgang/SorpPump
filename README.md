# Work in Progess!! Models can be used but documentation is not complete yet!

# SorpPump
Repository for sharing of sorption heat pump models. The models are available as MATLAB or Python Code in the respective directory.

## Working Principle
The working principle of the models is to solve energy and mass balances by using simplifying assumptions.

## Cycle configrurations
The following cylce configurations are available:
* Single Effect
* Double Effect
* Double Lift

# Working Fluids
The following working fluids are available:
* H2O-LiBr
* NH3-H2O

## Necessary Software
For the H2O-LiBr models the software CoolProp is used for refrigerant state calculation which is available as Open-Source tool here: http://www.coolprop.org/v4/HowGetIt.html 
For the NH3-H2O models additionally the software REFPROP is used for solution state calculation which is licensed. More information can be found here: https://pages.nist.gov/REFPROP-docs/#purchasing-refprop
