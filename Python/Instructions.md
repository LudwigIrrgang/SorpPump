# Python Absorption Heat Pump Models
## Cycle configrurations
The following cylce configurations are available:
* Single Effect
* Double Effect
* Double Lift

# Working Fluids
The following working fluids are available:
* H2O-LiBr
* NH3-H2O

## Necessary Software
For the H2O-LiBr models the software CoolProp is used for refrigerant state calculation which is available as Open-Source tool here: http://www.coolprop.org/v4/HowGetIt.html 
For the NH3-H2O models additionally the software REFPROP is used for solution state calculation which is licensed. More information can be found here: https://pages.nist.gov/REFPROP-docs/#purchasing-refprop

## Usage
Use the file 'main.py' as orientation for the usage of the models. You will find all necessary inputs and the an example for how to run the models there. Download the whole directory and make sure that the CoolProp and REFPROP software can be calles corretly.
