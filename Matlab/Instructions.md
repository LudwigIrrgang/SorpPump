# Matlab Absorption Heat Pump Models
## Cycle configrurations
The following cylce configurations are available:
- Single Effect
- Double Effect
- Double Lift
The following working fluids are available:
- H2O-LiBr
- NH3-H2O

## Necessary Software
For the H2O-LiBr models the software CoolProp is used for refrigerant state calculation which is available as Open-Source tool here: http://www.coolprop.org/v4/HowGetIt.html 
For the NH3-H2O models additionally the software REFPROP is used for solution state calculation which is licensed. More information can be found here: https://pages.nist.gov/REFPROP-docs/#purchasing-refprop

## Usage
Use the file 'run_AHP.m' as orientation for the usage of the models. You will find all necessary inputs and the an example for how to run the models there.
